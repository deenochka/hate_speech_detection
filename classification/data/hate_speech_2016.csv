racism,"@semzyxx @NAInfidels @owais00 Furthermore, you cannot identify a single verse of the Quran that limits the age of marriage of a girl."
racism,"@semzyxx @owais00 Again, a Muslim liar trying to change the subject to hide the proven fact that her prophet is a pedophile."
racism,@semzyxx Do you approve of your prophet raping children?
racism,@semzyxx @NAInfidels @owais00 I don't give a shit about what the Talmud says because  Jews all live under secular laws not under Talmud.
racism,@semzyxx @NAInfidels @owais00 But Muslims are dying to live under Sharia and to bring back all the vileness and barbarity of their prophet.
racism,"@semzyxx @NAInfidels @owais00 As you can see for yourself, pedophelia is illegal in Israel, but is legal in Muslim countries. Outlaw Islam!"
racism,"@semzyxx Do you approve of your pedophile prophet raping a 9 year old girl, like it says in 7 hadith?"
racism,"@semzyxx Your prophet was a low life murdering, raping, robbing, bigoted, sexist, pedophile."
racism,"@semzyxx Now, since you claim that Islam limits age of marriage, but produce no verses to back up your lies, you are blocked."
racism,@obsurfer84 This guy is a Muslim who is lying Mohammed. There are 7 Hadith that clearly and explicitly state that Aisha was 6 when married.
racism,When Muslims try to defend their prophet against pedophelia they never tell you about the proof that he was a pedo. http://t.co/19RSG7nHAh
racism,@obsurfer84 The story about her age came from both Aisha and Ursa. It can be found in both Bukhari and Muslim.
racism,"@obsurfer84 Furthermore, all the Hadiths about Aisha's age are classified as Sahih - meaning Sound."
racism,@obsurfer84 @teenage Dodge rambles on making assertion after assertion with zero evidence and no references in Quran or Hadith. It's garbage
racism,@obsurfer84 Defensive sword? ROFLMAO. The Muslims defended themselves all the way to France and India.
racism,@obsurfer84 What was Mohammed defending when he attacked the Jews of Khybar?
racism,@PatVPeters Funny how defenders of Islam like to bring up the crusades. But the Muslim crusaders were attacking Christianity first.

racism,@VannCastro @tweetybird2009 @PatVPeters Right. Every Pres in history has been heavily criticized. But doing it to Obama has to be racist.
racism,@obsurfer84 Wrong Jewish tribe microbrain.  The Jews of Khybar had nothing to do with Mohammed.
racism,@obsurfer84 They welcomed Islam with a sword at their throats. There was nothing kind about Islam. It was a religion designed for thugs.
racism,"@obsurfer84 You claim to be anti religion, yet you spend all your time lying for the benefit of Islam, the religion of hate."
racism,@obsurfer84 @teenage Let people read the Quran and see that it comes from hate. http://t.co/cuQDA0n32q
racism,@obsurfer84 @teenage Let people look at the polls that Muslims answered and see that they come from hate. http://t.co/j2BAMNBzi4
racism,@obsurfer84 @teenage It's a guide for nothing. It's Islam's claims of the laws of god.  And Islam's god is a terrorist. Islam's prophet too.
racism,"@obsurfer84 @teenage Yes, you can lie about Islam all you want and you can deny all the evidence all you want.  No one cares about opinion."
racism,"@obsurfer84 @teenage You can blab endlessly about love, but you defend a religion of hate - which is the action of a hater, namely you."
racism,"@obsurfer84 Mohammed's excuse in every aggression is, ""I had to attack because I heard they were going to attack""."
racism,@obsurfer84 But the truth is that Mohammed followers were worthless starving thugs that produced nothing and so wanted the riches of Khybar.
racism,@obsurfer84 And today many Muslims are still worthless thugs that produce nothing. They are either rescued by oil money or try to steal.
racism,@obsurfer84 Even your own link shows that the Jews were the producers and the Muslims lived by stealing others property.
racism,"@obsurfer84 Then, when there was no one left to rob, the Muslims returned to being dessert Bedouins still trying to rob each other."
racism,@obsurfer84 99% of all inventions come from the west. Islam has produced nothing in 1000 years. Mohammed was an illiterate who produced nada
racism,"@obsurfer84 The few things Islam came up with were from conquered people and came in spite of Islam, not because of it."
racism,@obsurfer84 The ME led the world in development before there was Islam and fell behind the world after Islam.
racism,@obsurfer84 And the Muslims robbed the wealthy merchants.
racism,"@obsurfer84 Now you are babbling like every Muslim conspiracy idiot. ""CIA created ISIS"".Utterly stupid and without evidence. You are blocked"

racism,"@scamp_faridxx @AbuAlbaraaSham Islam declared war on all humanity 1400 years ago, so talking about murderers of Muslims is total hypocrisy."

sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan Mohammed was a head chopper who beheaded 600 Jewish men in one day. Both ISIS and Hamas love beheading people.
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed approved in the Quran of sex slavery. ISIS is a firm believer in sex slavery.
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan #Islam wants women to stay in their houses and cover themselves. ISIS makes sure that they do.
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Islam is a strong supporter of murdering non Muslims. ISIS is a strong supporter of murdering non Muslims.
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed declared a Jihad against all non believers. ISIS is executing a Jihad against non believers.
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed loved robbing caravans and looting for a living. ISIS robs and lots for a living.
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed was a pedophile who married a child. ISIS marries many children. http://t.co/hB4uw1F5Zd
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed was a genocidal bigot who attacked Jews and Christians. ISIS and Hamas do exactly the same.
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed was a sexist who abused women. ISIS are all sexists and abuse women.
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Imagine a Muslim journalist making a case for why ISIS is not Islamic.  No self interest there. LOL.
sexism,@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ The religion of Islam is built on apartheid and ethnic cleansing.
sexism,"@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ What race are Muslims, poop for brains?"
sexism,@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ Mohammed stated clearly in the Hadith that he wanted Muslims to breed like rats so he could take over the world.
sexism,@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ The Muslim Palestinians have practically exterminated or driven off all the Christian Palestinians bozo.
sexism,@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ What Christian who is not insane would want to live under Sharia law?
sexism,@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ Any idiot would know that the expelling of Palestinians would not change the ratio of Christians to Muslims.
sexism,"@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ One thing about Muslims, they want to exterminate everyone who is not a Muslim. They are doing it around the world."
sexism,"@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ Of course Muslims are exterminating Christians in Egypt,Pakistan,Turkey, etc. Why would it be different in Palistine"
sexism,"@dankmtl @AAlwuhaib1977 @PeaceNotHate_ No asshole, the Israelis are defending themselves against this. https://t.co/8cmfoOZwxz"
sexism,@dankmtl If Israel had given Palestinians the right to return they would now be suffering the same fate of all minorities under Islam.
sexism,"@dankmtl @AAlwuhaib1977 @PeaceNotHate_ Actually, I don't think it is possible to distinguish between Islam and Nazism."
sexism,"@dankmtl @AAlwuhaib1977 @PeaceNotHate_ Your friends are the Palestinians who cut off gays heads, do honor killings, force Sharia."
sexism,"@dankmtl Again, idiot, none of that changes the ratio of Muslims to Christians in Palestine. Only Muslim bigotry and abuse changes it."
sexism,@dankmtl The prophet Mohammed fired the starting gun for the extermination of Jews and Christians from peninsula. http://t.co/V1IIOoItIg
sexism,@dankmtl They didn't steal anything. When Israel was attacked by Muslim armies they left instead of staying and fighting.
sexism,@dankmtl When they left the Israelis to be slaughtered they lost the land as they deserved.
sexism,"@dankmtl And as this moron Palestinian clearly explains, most of them are now Egyptians and Saudis and Jordanians. https://t.co/8cmfoOZwxz"
sexism,@dankmtl Load of BS. Their numbers fell steadily since then. And you're still too stupid to see that doesn't change ratios.
sexism,@dankmtl The prophet Mohammed started the hate fest against Jews by driving all three Jewish tribes out of Medina.
sexism,@dankmtl With the third Jewish tribe he beheaded all the men after they surrendered and sold all the women and children into slavery.
sexism,@dankmtl After chasing them all out of Medina he went to the Jewish oasis of Khybar and slaughtered most of the Jews there.
sexism,"@dankmtl Today the Hamas terrorists still call ""Khybar Khybar"" to the Jews when fighting them."
sexism,@dankmtl Hard to get stupider than you. Still no change in ratios justified by anything Israel did.
sexism,@dankmtl And off course the fact that the same is happening to minority populations all over the ME goes over your vacuous head.
sexism,"@dankmtl Here, butthead, this gives a good summary of the Muslim persecution of Christians in Palestine. http://t.co/gvLellbFdP"
sexism,"@dankmtl Hell, t Muslims are everywhere chanting death to everybody. Jews only have trouble with Muslims. Muslims have trouble with everyone"
sexism,@dankmtl What does that have to do with Muslim extermination of Jews?
sexism,"@dankmtl No, microbrain, I'm okay with Israel doing what they have to do to stop the same extermination the Muslims have done for 1400 yrs."
sexism,"@dankmtl Yeap, as a little Propaganda Nazi for terrorists you will reject everything that disproves your lies, even thought the numbers ..."
sexism,"@dankmtl No, the problem of the Palestinians and all Muslims is that they cannot stand for a Jewish state to exist on the peninsula."
sexism,"@dankmtl Hell, Palestinian Muslim assholes like this clearly state their intentions of religious jihad against Jews and you tell them that ."
sexism,@dankmtl what they tell you is their intention is not their intention.https://t.co/8cmfoOZwxz
sexism,"@dankmtl The holocaust was by Nazis. And the people who fought, killed and stopped them where Christian westerners."
sexism,@dankmtl But no Muslims stop any other Muslims from carrying out their genocide. They only aid and applaud them.
sexism,@dankmtl 1400 years ago my ass. That was the beginning and it has never stopped. It is an ingrained part of Islam.
sexism,"@dankmtl And the number of Christians in Israel is increasing, while in all Muslim countries it is shrinking."
sexism,@dankmtl Are you now going to play the ignorant argumentative asshole and pretend there is no Arabian peninsula?
sexism,@dankmtl Good night asshole. Hope you get run over by a bus.
sexism,"@DrHaque @MaxBlumenthal @NYCJulieNYC @mehdirhasan @tnr Yes, ISIS defames Islam by following it to the letter. http://t.co/DoNlOQYGYJ"
sexism,@AAlwuhaib1977 @dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ terrorists that have taken the church over. She was born an American and so was never subject to ...
sexism,@AAlwuhaib1977 @dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ the abuse that Christians who are stuck living with violent Muslims endure.
sexism,"@AAlwuhaib1977 @dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ Her very actions are proof that she is a liar and a propagandist, because if she did to Hamas what .."
sexism,"@AAlwuhaib1977 @dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ ...She does to the IDF, Hamas would have put a bullet in her head long ago."
sexism,@AAlwuhaib1977 @dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ It's great that you provided Arraf's name. Now I understand how these anti Semitic orgs. function.
sexism,"@AAlwuhaib1977 All the lies they tell and the mantras they repeat about apartheid, etc. are all scripted propaganda and not spontaneous."
sexism,@AAlwuhaib1977 @dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ And of course Christians all over the world are oppressed daily by Muslim bigotry.
sexism,"@AAlwuhaib1977 It's not Israelis that are constantly murdering Christians &amp; Hindus for blasphemy in Pakistan, it's Genocidal Muslim mobs."
sexism,"@AAlwuhaib1977 Yes, Muslim bigots are murdering Christians all over Africa and have been for decades."
sexism,@AAlwuhaib1977 And Muslims are murdering raping and forcefully converting Christians in Egypt and have been for centuries.
sexism,@AAlwuhaib1977 And the Muslim bigots have been attacking Hindus and Buddhists and atheists and anamists all over the world daily.
sexism,"@AAlwuhaib1977 Wrong again, it is the Muslims murdering the Hindus in India, Kashmir, Bangladesh, and Pakistan."
sexism,@AAlwuhaib1977 Apartheid is a propaganda word used by terrorist supporters to further the cause of Muslim terrorism.
sexism,"@AAlwuhaib1977 The Muslim mobs of Bangladesh attack Hindus, destroying thousands of homes and temples. http://t.co/INLiK2TlCP"

sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @Ajzionts I think your Muslim friends are raping girls around the world. http://t.co/liSKP9U8Uq
sexism,"@AAlwuhaib1977 No,it's the absolute truth and you can verify it through hundreds of sources. Your anti semitism is scripted propaganda."
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @Ajzionts Has Bloomenthal ever written about the endless attacks by his Muslims on Egyptian Copts? http://t.co/xeGlOFsNWJ
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @Ajzionts Has Blumenthal ever written about all the Pakistani Hindus &amp; Christians murdered by Muslims http://t.co/YlflnnFwBH
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @Ajzionts Has Blumenthal ever written about ceaseless Muslim violence against Hindus in Bangladesh. http://t.co/INLiK2TlCP
sexism,"@MaxBlumenthal @Ajzionts Nope, Blumenthal ignores the countless cases of Muslim violence against minorities around the world, and instead..."
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal @Ajzionts ...tries to make a case that the Israelis protecting themselves against Muslim bigotry are the ones to blame.
sexism,@AAlwuhaib1977 Kiss my ass. I don't read books by Muslim bigots written to promote their fascist murdering genocide of humanity.
sexism,@MDBishop82 @railgirl1952 @LyndaG1963 @Coslopuss @MaxBlumenthal In fact Blumenthal's Palestinian friends behead gays.
sexism,"@MaxBlumenthal Max asks as his Palestinian friends are beheading gays, doing honor killings, driving Palestinian Christians out of existence"
sexism,@kareemMajjour @Bennettruth @MaxBlumenthal Palestinians train the children to hate Israelis and then us their confrontations for propaganda
sexism,@LyndaG1963 @MDBishop82 @Coslopuss @MaxBlumenthal @railgirl1952 Which is why the joint blacks and Muslims are murdering police in Ferguson.
sexism,"@AAlwuhaib1977 So while thousands of churches, temples, synagogs have been destroyed by Muslim biggots, you only worry about one Muslim ...."
sexism,@AAlwuhaib1977 Mosque that is still standing. Typical Muslim terrorist asshole.
sexism,@MaxBlumenthal Max looks at the genocide of 7000 Ezidis and countless Christians by his Muslims friends and writes not a word. #Islam

none,@p8952_ @mjg59 the fact that twitter makes it easier to interact with those you're not connected to may have more to do with this.

none,"In the past 12 hrs, GG hashtag saw 1018 tweets/hr (776 of which were RTs). Min: 662 (473) Max: 1519 (1233). majority of non-RT came from bot"
none,"Tweets which saw the most RTs tend to be questionable, abusive, and almost always aimed at @spacekatgal, @thequinnspiracy, @femfreq, and me."
none,"In the past 12h, @spacekatgal is seeing the most targeted abuse, with 194 (36 OC/158 RT) GG hashtaged tweets mentioning her. Congrats!"
none,"This is followed not-so-closely by @femfreq, with 80 (44 OC/36 RT) GG hashtagged tweets mentioning her. Better luck next time."
none,"When we look at all mentions of a username, including RTs, @spacekatgal has received 1611 in the past 12h. @femfreq has received 911."
none,Can't wait until I get more data on this. But it looks like @spacekatgal should probably avoid her mentions at 8-10AM PDT Sundays. ;)
none,@crash_matrix @whatsershame rofl

none,"@JimmyMcCunty @Spacekatgal oh, darn, you can't? shoot."
none,@davidsgallant @Spacekatgal not enough data to know for certain. just what i'm seeing today. she's getting a pretty steady level since then
none,"RT @eksith: @FeministSpanker @freebsdgirl ""Could've fooled anyone!"" Was this too subtle? http://t.co/U04K34fwj0"
none,@Sir5000 hm?
none,literally #devops
none,@spacekatgal we could do something fun with this. i could see how many tweets you get from users you've blocked.
none,The goal here is to eventually have up a pretty dashboard where you can go and see up-to-the-minute stats on this stuff.
none,"I'm starting to get a grasp for when the notification ugliness is going to happen, so it could be an interesting incident notification tool."
none,"however, it doesn't scale. i can use this to track up to a certain number of users. if they target a user i'm not looking at, won't work."
none,"it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs, i guess, and *.wsp files that are deleted if they aren't updated in N minutes?"
none,"but that seems gross, and not really how this tool should be used. can do better w/other things, this is more for an overview."
none,@cheeseplus @obfuscurity wsp is... sigh. but i'm just using docker in aws with a grafana image. fuck configuring this crap.

none,@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i don't wanna devops this. i just want it to work so i can do other things. i need a devops.
none,"@cheeseplus yeah. i'm kind of feeling like for what i'm doing, wsp is ok. for doing more granular monitoring, redis would be good."

none,@vex0rian @Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn getting into inst is slow. it's oomed. prob going to have to aws console and kick it.
none,@ctmf they are already setting up  bots to tweet with the hashtag to inflate it. i don't really see this making much of a difference.
none,"@ctmf but if they do, i'm happy to turn my graphs over to twitter's abuse department. i don't think the people i'm watching would risk that."

none,"@GemmaNoon ie: things not as open for interpretation, such as numeric or boolean data (is following/is not following, etc)."
none,@GemmaNoon it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups. i think it'll be useful.
none,"@GemmaNoon rather amused that despite their protests, GG is the only group i've looked at where abuse is easily predicted based on followers"
none,@sschinke @TsundereRager previous versions of ebooks_example (code using twitter_ebooks) wouldn't reply to *_ebooks accounts.

none,"Verified accts for all is an OK idea, but too much administrative overhead. There are better ways, which I've talked about in the past."
none,verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.
none,"however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients."
none,the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata.
none,"add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update, natch)."
none,does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than N days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update.
none,"phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from GV), but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse."
none,"in short, there needs to be a verified that isn't Verified. requiring govt ids will cause probs. unique phone less problematic, not perfect."
none,"don't worry, i'm sure no one will be like ""WHAT A GREAT IDEA"" until a dude takes credit for it. &lt;3"
none,@tomdcc a lot of people don't have cell phones. i was one of them for 2 years. ;) i only used GV. against the idea of disallowing GV.
none,@tomdcc not everyone can afford cell phones. GV is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing.
none,"@dominictarason i was talking to twitter about it a few weeks ago, talked about it here a month ago (neener). :P"
none,@eDRoaCH unaware of their issues. do they not have cell phones/access to GV?
none,@eDRoaCH i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for SMS.
none,@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required.
none,@tomdcc it's very easy to change your GV #.
none,it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity.
none,pseudonyms are good. own it! anonymous is not the same thing. what jason/wadhwa are promoting would require ID/home address/PAY TO USE
none,go figure that silicon valley circle jerk elite don't realize that some people can't afford $10/month to not be harassed.
none,*whispers* hey guys. being free from abuse/harassment doesn't have to be monetized. it should be for everyone. i can show you the way.
none,take off your VC fedoras and think about what this really is. it's about the right that anyone has to not be harassed &amp; threatened.
none,"so, my yammering sleazeball cupcakes, you can go with http://t.co/TDToqiuQDc and i'll go my way.

I fight for the users."
none,@teh_maxh you don't have to have a phone to get SMS. you have to have internet. which is also required for twitter.
none,@eDRoaCH @twitter the number doesn't have to be stored to be ensured unique...
none,@eDRoaCH @twitter think about how passwords work. are they stored in plaintext? can the provider easily decrypt them? nope.
none,"@tomdcc oh god that sounds like a horrible idea. privacy problems. also, twitter likely wouldn't be storing the number. that would be bad."
none,i'm still entertained that jason's idea is to either pay a fee or make your acct protected. i'd love to hear his thoughts on short skirts.
none,"@eDRoaCH i think we shouldn't make assumptions if they are used in this manner, which is diff from their original purpose."
none,@teh_maxh still extra work to go through. most trolls move on and find new victims.
none,"@dylanw last i checked, baldwin was verified."
none,@tomdcc you can only have one GV # per acct at any given time.
none,@GlennF only if you want to laugh at how fucking privileged he is. what a tool.
none,@tomdcc accepting pull requests for better ideas that don't violate pseudonymity/privacy. &lt;3

none,@limbclock if you only want 3 people to use it.
none,"@Spacekatgal i'm FOSS at heart. i think the tools should be open for all to use. however, for monitoring services, things that require infra"
none,"@Spacekatgal it makes sense to ask for donations to keep it up and going, and to pay for the dev work. ideally, this is 100% crowd-funded."
none,"@Spacekatgal this is more from a consumer side, though. from a business side? one could see email SPAM as falling under that category."
none,"@Spacekatgal and businesses often pay for solutions like that. i have no problem charging businesses, just individuals."
none,"@tomdcc multiple gmail accts. this is all a lot of effort, though. most trolls just pick a new target."
none,"@tomdcc nothing will ever be perfect, but this is a good start towards fixing a HUGE percentage of harassment."
none,@Spacekatgal yeahhhh. they were operating a loss until facebook bought them. fbook didn't buy them to make money off the service.
none,@Spacekatgal it was to get the userbase. and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data.
none,@Spacekatgal twitter allows 13 yr olds. 13 yr olds don't generally have bank accts. *lots* of people don't have bank accts/work in cash.
none,"@Spacekatgal $1 may not seem that far out of reach to a lot of people in the US, but we're also far removed from the class it would impact."
none,@Spacekatgal 80% of his points are bullshit taken from white cis male standpoint. no harassment on fbook? pft. providing ID/addy? NOPE.
none,@Spacekatgal the client/web experience being similar are key. i don't know if twitter client has the additional controls verified accts have
none,@limbclock i wouldn't do that.
none,@sschinke @teh_maxh what are you talking about?
none,@GlennF @Spacekatgal i read it only because i already knew what it was going to say. he's not a creative thinker.
none,"@GlennF @Spacekatgal he's regurgitating the same ideas that people have had before. they were bad then, shockingly, still bad now."
none,"@MaxwellTolvo @Spacekatgal they don't do this right now. i mean, unless you are becoming verified."
none,@tomdcc i met with them weeks ago. :P  who knows what they might do? i certainly don't. but we're talking.
none,@sschinke @teh_maxh it sets a bad precedent.
none,"@sschinke @teh_maxh as a guess, anyways."
none,"Oh god. I am so stubborn.

Just realized the only thing it took to push me off the fence in the real name/pseudonym debate was jason/wadhwa."
none,"@GlennF @Spacekatgal it is rather funny how all of us are so completely different, yet complement each other's skill sets so well."

none,"@dylanw I'm sorry you don't have any time, that sucks. But next time you might want to look further before useless vague callouts."

none,"Someday, a gater will have an epiphany regarding the definitions for DoS/DDoS. This unbelievable feat will be a sign of the apocalypse."
none,I don't understand why a simple technical definition is giving them so much of a problem. They seem to think DoS/DDoS == excessive packets.
none,"DoS/DDoS doesn't refer to a technique or method of transport.

It's largely defined by intention + end result.

This is not rocket surgery."
none,"if you want, you can classify an influx of notifications (dogpile!) as unintentional DDoS, as it makes core functionality unusable to you."
none,"It's super common to run into an unintentional DoS, especially in dev. Ever make a stupid mistake that caused a critical lack of resources?"
none,"Maybe your program forked until it could fork no longer, and you didn't have restrictions on. Maybe you sent an inappropriate amount of UDP."
none,Will the dev that has never forgotten to put in sleep statements or increment counters or wrote a poorly designed loop please stand up?
none,@coconono there's no hard definition of what constitutes DoS beyond lack of service. Service is open to mean many things.

none,"@milfgaardian Depends on shade. When doing blues, most MP fades out greyish blue, most SFX fades out w/green tint."

none,@a_man_in_black gross. i'd look weird with no hair.

none,@milfgaardian pravana blue - NOT pastels - mixed with a touch of purple to make the fade gorgeous + pravana clear. i swear by it.

none,"Talked about Weev &amp; full disclosure mailing list post. Baph doxxing, swat threats. Family &amp; friends being threatened. Being target of a mob."
none,It was difficult. I questioned if it was a good idea until someone in the crowd came forward for a hug &amp; started crying. Then I was crying.
none,Then q&amp;a for both of us keynote speakers got hijacked to show harassment happening live. Both of us talked about diff aspects of harassment.
none,"Talked about the need for support, mentors. People that understand because they've been through it all, too."
none,I was blown away. I couldn't even think of a more impactful way of getting across the point that this is a problem we need to talk about.
none,Thank you to everyone at #GirlDevWeek for the kind words. Thank you for letting me speak. Thank you for listening.

none,"""Thanks to you, now people are attacking me on twitter"" - uh, well, actually, we hated what you were doing before NPR aired this episode."
none,"""these are women not on social media. these are women not like the ones you are interviewing."" - because women on social media aren't real."
none,"""They don't relate to these women on social media. these activists, these feminists. they don't relate to them. they are more humble."""
none,all of these quotes are from @wadhwa on @tldr.
none,"sorry i'm not humble, dick."
none,@thelindsayellis @WNYC listen to the latest episode. it's all explained.
none,"""kelly, i'm really disappointed in you"" - can disappointed wadhwa be a meme?"
none,"""i don't need this money, frankly"" - wait, what money? wadhwa said all the proceeds were going to women &amp; he didn't take money for speaking."
none,"""i encourage your bosses to listen to what you just said"" - oh. let's appeal to the male authority, right?"
none,"meredith - ""mr wadhwa, i would love to broadcast this entire interview the way it is.""  DEAD SILENCE FROM WADHWA."
none,"""ally in social media is a slang word. my slang is not good."" oh, here come allegations of racism. countdown."
none,@MetroidThief about halfway through.
none,wadhwa is now blaming npr for bad health.
none,"""[women] don't understand how journalism works. that i have given women a platform."""
none,"""i understand that some women are angry at me, but they [...] don't understand how journalism works."" uh, hi. i'm in newsweek, too."
none,"and i used to be a tech evangelist. i have some idea of how the press works, but thanks for the clear examples of mansplaining."
none,".@wadhwa keeps claiming he's not profiting. look, dude. we both know how the speaker circuit works. it's about rep. you profit indirectly."

none,@manymanywords so um. how did you keep from laughing or hanging up? i'm in awe.
none,"What I took from all of this is that @wadhwa doesn't bother researching anyone - just assumes if they disagree w/him, they are misinformed."
none,RT @wadhwa: .@sarahjeong This issue isn't about me any more. It is about ethics in journalism. How a public radio station slanders and then…
none,"ethics in journalism. ETHICS. IN. JOURRRRRRRNALISM. No wonder he's friends with that walking burrito fart, milo."
none,@djtyrant i was pretty proud of that.
none,"If you are feeling perturbed about women that aren't humble, kindly go set yourself on fire."

none,RT @MetroidThief: @freebsdgirl OH MY GOD. WHAT IF HE'S TRYING TO TEACH WOMEN TO BE ASSERTIVE BY GETTING THEM TO TELL HIM TO GO TO HELL.
none,"I just can't get over how wadhwa wouldn't believe that woman was a dev because on Twitter, you can ""be anybody"""
none,A lot of women in tech have had to commit themselves so utterly to their work in order to be taken seriously. He's denying their identity.
none,"For many of us, our job is part of who we are because we've had to fight so hard to get where we are."

none,"It's like faking being humble, but then, in the next breath, being upset that people can disagree with you. Must just be personal agendas."
none,"Oh. there goes @wadhwa using his position to shame @shanley publicly again over her sex life. SET YOURSELF ON FIRE YOU SEXIST SCUMBAG, thx."
none,"Can't believe he did that AGAIN. Jesus. Hey dudes? Don't do that. Not ever. Ask yourself, would I do this to a guy? No? Then fucking STOP."
none,Being shamed for past relationships is one of the many bullshit things dudes do to silence women. Especially women in tech.
none,"Because if we like computers, we sure as hell better not have ever dated or fucked anyone, ever."
none,Hey guys. Remember when weev released illegally obtained info about my sex life on the full disclosure mailing list bcz I was too uppity?

none,"hey guys, the MRAs found me. oh noes. whatever will I do as a damsel in distress? oh gosh. plz stop. such a hapless victim."
none,plz stop posting pics of me that i posted a few weeks ago. i care so much about what people think of my appearance. it's what i live for.
none,"Oh, darling MRAs. You making jabs at my appearance won't keep me from working to provide tools so others can shut you down. &lt;3"
none,But I guess you're not really sure how to react when a woman has resources to help others fight back. Such a quandary. So perplexing. :\
none,"When the most you've got to throw at me is tweeting insults, you don't really have any weapon at all."
none,"@slagkick oh, yeah. i spam the hell out of those buttons."

none,@AndreaFaulds i need to update that. ^.^
none,"@AndreaFaulds @ggautoblocker it's true, there's a risk. but the same risk is involved in just following the twitter account."
none,"@AndreaFaulds @ggautoblocker even with twitter allowing pseudonyms, it doesn't really prevent the trolls from tracking them down."

none,"@srhbutts poor @grimachu. it's not that he wouldn't date SJWs, it's that my bot is the only SJW that will have a conversation with him."
none,"OK, look. Someone is messaging me on something. I hear the ding. I don't know which account, which service, which computer. Uh. DM me."
none,"@Nibelsnarfabarf @srhbutts @GRIMACHU if you reallllly want that, search for ggautoblocker. i ran some ads last night."
none,@Nibelsnarfabarf @srhbutts @GRIMACHU it is really funny all the assumptions they make about how it works - and how much they are wrong.
none,"Yesterday, a dude that SWATed someone admitted that GamerGate - more specifically, someone on the GamerGate sourcelist - paid them to do so."
none,"Now that person has been doxxed on 8chan. And despite this being the person who posted my &amp; others' home address, suddenly he sees a problem"
none,"I'm not going to say I told you so. However, I will say that you'll probably see this, and you know my email address if you need help."
none,It was incredibly fucking difficult to type that.
none,"I doubt he'll bother emailing, but despite his past actions, no one should have to deal with shit like this."
none,@ChrisWarcraft I really just want to curl up and nap. But it seems quite a few people are dealing with doxxing fallout today on both sides.
none,"It's been a really long Saturday. I still haven't slept. This is why it's still Saturday. I'm tired &amp; I just want to curl up, but waiting."
none,I know of at least 3 people that are dealing with police today after being doxxed on 8chan. Trying to be available if I'm needed.
none,@Trigger_Check the guy who paid.
none,Please stop with all of the karma/negative comments. There's a bigger issue here than the person that was targeted.
none,"In many states, we've got laws that specifically protect against this kind of thing. However, they aren't enforced due to education/funding."
none,"Feelings about the person involved need to be separated from the real issue, which is advocacy, education, law, and tools."
none,"The current system is inadequate. Some of us are experienced at navigating these pitfalls, and we can help you."
none,@RealityForger CA has some interesting ways of getting around jurisdiction issues. Still researching other states.
none,@CafeChatNoir i think it's because i'm too tired to have feelings.
none,@funjon that's... actually kind of interesting. i'll give them a call later next week. i need to talk to them anyways.

none,"Frankly, I have more legal and tech resources than a hashtag. Plese go spew your hate group propaganda elsewhere. @PendragonTarot"

none,@KaitlynBurnell weird.
none,@Vodage @PendragonTarot gamergate isn't really sjws? it's for people that don't want to get notifications from gamergaters.
none,"@Shake_Well what he did was wrong and should be prosecuted. however, he's now been doxxed and targeted as well. it's a clusterfuck."
none,"@TheRealVordox oh, i see. you're another useless GG supporter. lol. go away."
none,@delfuego @PendragonTarot TIL I'm the district attorney.

none,"@jbradfield that's, ah, all of my kitchen, really. i have a thing for english tea roses patterns, too."
none,I'm going to cut in here - despite blocking you - to explain something that seems to confuse many people. @PendragonTarot
none,"This is a criminal case, not a civil case. This means that it's up to the police to decide if it's worth prosecuting. @PendragonTarot"
none,"While you can hire a lawyer to help you speak to the police, that's kind of where their - and YOUR - involvement ends. @PendragonTarot"
none,"If someone has had a crime committed personally against them online, the police aren't likely to listen to anyone BUT them. @PendragonTarot"
none,This is not legal advice. but common sense. What I can do is help people know what to say to police or help find a lawyer. @PendragonTarot
none,"So please take your accusations of ""WHY AREN'T YOU PROSECUTING, EVIL ANTIGG SCUM"" and go educate yourself. @PendragonTarot"
none,"It doesn't surprise me that GG has turned my offer of help for one of their own into a reason to screech at me, but it's still irritating."

none,@ShriekAPotomos @CrashOverrideNW you're searching her name and contacting people that talk to her? that's a bit creepy/stalkerish.
none,"@ShriekAPotomos @CrashOverrideNW As to if I'm working with her, that's none of your business. This isn't an adequate use of your time. Shoo."
none,"I don't comment on who I might be helping, and I'm not here to pass judgement on anyone's activities."
none,"Telling me ""DON'T HELP THIS PERSON, THEY ARE NOT REALLY VICTIMS"" probs isn't going to get you the reaction for which you are looking."
none,"@ShriekAPotomos @CrashOverrideNW someone else - which means people are actively searching her name, which is still creepy."
none,@ShriekAPotomos @CrashOverrideNW I help everyone that asks. I'm not here to pass judgment on anyone that comes looking for help.
none,"RT @cambrian_man: @freebsdgirl If there is a 'culture war' to be fought, it should over whether or not harassment is acceptable, not when i…"
none,"@Jen_X_Infinity @ShriekAPotomos @CrashOverrideNW hi. i still saw your tweet. one, i'm female. obviously. two, this isn't helping."
none,sigh. I need to work on building out my legal contacts to encompass more states.
none,"@sarahjeong yo, do you know of a reliable breakdown of harassment/stalking laws for each state?"
none,@sarahjeong searching for &amp; reading each state's penal codes individually is tedious.
none,"@OutworldDOTA2 i'm very entertained that all it takes is ""155 IQ"" for me to know precisely who is being discussed."
none,@sarahjeong that would be awesome. &lt;3
none,"@sarahjeong i'm envious of your education. :P  knowing how to interpret some things seems tricky, to say the least."
none,@emily_esque I would love that. would you mind DMing me your email address? can shoot you an email later today.
none,@Jen_X_Infinity i know that feel.
none,"@sarahjeong well, that just made my life much easier. :P"
none,@sarahjeong this is mostly what i need. interesting to see that some states don't have statues on both.
none,@ShriekAPotomos Anyone that is getting harassed is welcome to come to me for help. it's all anonymous.
none,"@ShriekAPotomos if not anonymous, then at the very least, privileged information."
none,"@beardyblue @emily_esque general folks in the legal field at this point, but issues will mostly center around local harassment/stalking laws"
none,@beardyblue @emily_esque &amp; possibly being able to provide referrals for people that want someone to help them navigate reporting to PD
none,@beardyblue @emily_esque police tend to take reports of online harassment/threats a lot more seriously when a lawyer is involved.
none,"@beardyblue @emily_esque these would likely fall under the lines of pro-bono work, at least until my NPO is up to help fund."
none,"@beardyblue @emily_esque i'm not entirely certain how all of this is going to work, so i'm still feeling it out."
none,"RT @srhbutts: CEO of sony europe vehemently, unequivocally condemns #gamergate as misogynistic harassment. http://t.co/0M07MuT5AY"

none,"@kebesays no, my blog post. :)"
none,@kebesays &lt;3 kathy sierra. everything she writes is pretty awesome.
none,@MetroidThief it was difficult for me as well until i realized that one could be a victim and still fight back.
none,"@MetroidThief for victims of abuse, it's often not discussed because of a feeling of shame. victim assumes fault, then public assigns blame."
none,haha http://t.co/x01ghRTb8O

none,@Celestalon @holinka you're both awesome. ;) Thank you for your work.
none,A *huge* thank you to @onthemedia. Giving wadhwa a platform with which to prove his character was of great help to #stopwadhwa2015.
none,"He's said that he's backing out, but I think this remains to be seen. However, I'm optimistic."
none,"I have no intent on linking to the articles where he stated he was backing out. They were an attempt to save face, not an apology."
none,"@MyersNFL oh, you haven't heard it? it was amazing."
none,"@MyersNFL oh, gosh. i hope you feel better. :("

none,"@xmjEE ugh, what did he do this time?"
none,"@xmjEE also, mentioning both of us in the same tweet is pretty much a sure-fire way to make sure that they do notice &amp; jump on me."

none,"Uh. This is what /angry looks like with undead. It's supposed to be fist in air, not slapping my own butt. http://t.co/YGzCldXqWQ"
none,"Oh, hell. Is Blizzard proxying tweets instead of sending the tweet content directly to twitter from the WoW client?"
none,I guess that's one way to get around the user token count limitation per app ID.
none,I need to think about this. I don't think I like this.
none,I think the biggest problem I have with it is that there's too much of a reliance on WoW services for an external mechanism.
none,"Blizzard has had issues in the past with certain things being delayed (achievements, D3). I would strongly dislike a tweet being delayed."
none,I'm still not 100% certain this is happening. But the delay between sending a tweet and seeing it appear is far too long.

none,There is currently a vocal male on twitter that claims to be all about anti-harassment. He has defended GamerGate in the past.
none,"At this moment in time, I am unaware of any effort he has made into this space. I'm tied in w/many orgs. His name has never once come up."
none,He's been offered contact info from those he's speaking with should he care to contribute. He's utilized none of this. I am unimpressed.
none,"If you're interested in working on solutions, we'd love to have your help. However, I can spot a flail for media attention from a mile away."
none,Don't think that it won't go unnoticed/unchallenged. Don't put on a cape unless you plan on being a hero. It's not a photo op. It's a job.
none,"@GavinRamblesOn what this person has done is not just voiced an opinion. i'm not going to get a pile-on going, so i'm not giving specifics."
none,"Since this was questioned, I should be clear. I'm not talking about supporters, or just people with opinions."
none,"I'm talking about people that take an active stand to say they want to create solutions for harassment, but do nothing beyond get RTed."
none,"For everyone that is involved in this space, there's a huge personal risk. People get targeted. Friends and family get targeted."

none,"@KaitlynBurnell to be clear, i'm not bringing this up to defend bri. i'm aware that she's fully capable of defending herself."
none,@KaitlynBurnell the use of the word 'bully' in this context is worrisome and relevant to any conversation i have.
none,"@KaitlynBurnell given the *massive* glee i'm seeing from GG irt that tweet, it's concerning that he's not retracting or explaining 'bully'"
none,"@KaitlynBurnell if i was looking for pitchforks, i'd point out a white dude in a position of power accused a minority of bullying him. :P"
none,"@KaitlynBurnell thank you for calling me on this, though. i probably should have made that more clear in the original tweets."

none,Did you hear that? That's the sound of a bunch of women in tech setting up filters to fwd emails from @ninaburleigh to /dev/null. Good job.
none,I reached out to @ninaburleigh with concerns the day the article was published. No response. Nina cares more about page views than problems.
none,"She had her chance to understand, but she's decided to dig in her heels. Whelp. Lesson learned, eh?"
none,"@Ethelmonster @ninaburleigh @wadhwa lol, she was one of the people that gave him a platform and then ignored detractors."
none,"According to @ninaburleigh, we should be happy that dudes are talking about feminism. Even if they are telling us how we are doing it wrong."
none,This is 50 shades of bullshit. Wadhwa said that women that disagreed with him were just looking for attention. THESE WERE HIS WORDS.
none,"If this is an ally, then fuck everything &amp; set the world on fire. @ninaburleigh was dumb enough to get sucked into his bullshit vortex."

none,"@PeerWorker yes. given that one group routinely posts mutilated bodies on twitter along with american passports, i'd say they are worse."
none,@PeerWorker and i couldn't give less fucks about alienating followers by giving them an opinion they don't like.

none,@PeerWorker this is what you just said. you just compared online harassment to mutilated bodies. this is demeaning.
none,".@PeerWorker online harassment is a serious problem, and it needs to be addressed. but making false equivalencies won't get you anywhere."
none,"Let me make this super fucking clear. I will not compromise my beliefs in any way just to get donations. That isn't happening, ever."
none,I appreciate every donation received. But ppl that threaten to pull funding if I don't say the things they want to hear can fuck themselves.
none,@PeerWorker @krisaubuchon holy shit. seriously? i've done research into both groups. I've seen the tweets &amp; patterns. GamerGate isn't ISIS.
none,"No one said threats weren't serious. However, there's a difference between ISIS and GamerGate. @PeerWorker"
none,You're not going to get the response you're looking for. Give up. @PeerWorker
none,RT @PeerWorker: @freebsdgirl The threats are either serious or they aren't.  I guess you don't view #GamerGate as emotional terrorism.
none,@composerose yeah.
none,@PeerWorker why do you think that you know more about the abuse i personally receive than i do?
none,"@PeerWorker you made a false equivalency, I called it on you, and you threatened financial consequences."

none,"Until twitter provides us with a way to filter new accounts or provides a higher barrier to entry, these are just words that mean little."
none,The Developer Policy needs an update that allows us to filter non-promoted tweets. Twitter clients continue to have bugs w/large block lists

none,How should I even classify this? Wielding a mob? Indirect bullying? I'm not sure.
none,RT @brendensparks: @freebsdgirl It's like somebody juggling knives who won't take responsibility if one of them hurts an onlooker.
none,The amount of Mean Girls mentality coming from GG supporters is hilarious. ON WEDNESDAYS WE EMAIL KOTAKU.
none,"INTEL, YOU CAN'T SIT WITH US"
none,"""If you have ever felt personally victimized by ethics in games journalism, raise your hand"""
none,"@PhoenixDK i'm thinking about it. ideas aren't really fully formed, though."
none,@PhoenixDK i think there's a really fine line beyond being vocal about your experiences and indirect bullying.
none,"@PhoenixDK yeah, i need to start looking at finding a... oh wait. i can't drop that news yet. :P"
none,"@zeynep @twitter @delbius omg, is that what happened? i keep hitting the wrong button."
none,"RT @zeynep: Ugh, @Twitter. It was so much better when ""report as spam"" and ""block"" were IN A SINGLE MENU. Please recombine them. Paging @de…"
none,"OK, that's enough poking the bear. Have a lot to do today. My most difficult decision is going to be what to wear. &gt;.&gt;"
none,"@zeynep @delbius that makes sense. also, how horrible is it that block has become muscle memory? :P"
none,That moment when I think that I'm out of coffee... then pull 12 oz of ground arabica out of my backpack. Yes! More glory to the coffee gods.
none,"@jessimckenzi @zeynep @twitter @delbius @TweetDeck confirmed, seeing the same thing in *web*."
none,My fav part of skimming GG tweets is seeing so many people insist that they are unable to develop their views with experience.
none,ie: they will still feel this way in 5 years. lollll.
none,They also love to add 10 years to my age. Which doesn't bother me. I grew up envious of UNIX beards.
none,"This is coming from the same group that claimed I faked my LinkedIn because it was ""impossible"" for a 33 yr old to have done all of that."
none,"This might be my favorite tweet by rogue, ever. https://t.co/HhSQGdlHgN  Because he assumes my twitter handle is my UNIX login."
none,"UNIX logins are restricted to 8 characters, darling. FreeBSD uses SVN, not git. I believe SVN history is imported to github."
none,"And then there's this person, who suggests PC-BSD because FreeBSD are all sjws. https://t.co/ubnhhv9yQ0"
none,"PC-BSD is a fork that is mostly funded by iXSystems, the organization that runs FreeBSD marketing. It's a frontend on top of FreeBSD."
none,All that collusion in the BSD community sure is hard to keep track of.
none,"In short, this is the most hilarious GamerGate BSD fail I have ever seen. #FreeBSD #OpenBSD #PCBSD http://t.co/poaOZ93QEf"
none,"btw, guys. I'm an admin of the OpenBSD facebook group. So, you know. COLLUSION."
none,RT @danimal: @freebsdgirl wait until they find out the BSDs share patches and fixes.
none,"Oh, yeah. and FreeBSD is the OS that runs on your Playstations. Why so salty?"
none,@iglvzx he expects unix logins to map to github usernames - which they rarely will.
none,@Osw94k I would put cash money on them not understanding your profile pic.
none,@tpw_rules I can prove that my code is in FreeBSD. And there are articles that state that FreeBSD is running on the PS3 and PS4.
none,"@mdesjardins for some parts of the company, yes. a lot of freebsd devs work there."
none,"@deathofrats01 yup. ^.^ unless it's your field, it's not surprising that you wouldn't know."
none,@pr1ntf they searched for my *twitter name* in freebsd's *github*
none,@deathofrats01 I know *nothing* about writing code in windows. :P
none,@ChrisWarcraft i have never seen a single indication that roguestar is in any way technically competent.
none,"RT @ChrisWarcraft: @freebsdgirl

none,Posing for extra style points before wrecking *everyone*. #selfie #warlords http://t.co/Jr11tzm49x
none,"@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r to be fair, most of my activity happened under my own commit bit."
none,@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r but rogue isn't really... dev competent. he thinks all dev happens under github.
none,Watching other BSD devs tell roguestar he's wrong and it is delicious.
none,BSD is a good community. Wandering into it and attacking one of the few women contributors is going to get some people talking.
none,"So, just to save you all some time, BSD is my family. The only negative response GG ever received was from a non-dev."
none,"I have never felt more supported and safe than I do around the FreeBSD developer community. They are amazing, and I love them."
none,The smear tactics aren't going to work. These people have known me for over a decade.
none,"So far, the primary response I've heard from the FreeBSD dev community in regards to all of this is ""how can we help?"""
none,And I've asked them to stay uninvolved. But attacking my work with them? GLHF. You're bringing it on yourself.
none,It's been several years since I've contributed code. This was due to a conflict with an employer. I *asked* for my commit bit to be retired.
none,"But all of these attacks of ""not enough commits"" or ""had a dude do it for you"" or ""slept with people"" proves my point. Thanks for that."
none,@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r I think I got mine because no one else wanted to touch the code I was working with. :)
none,@SilverMillsy nope! 34 in september. :)
none,@SilverMillsy i could not be paid enough to live through my 20's again. :P
none,@leel8on indeed. although the police were fairly nice. :)

none,"@SlaunchaMan interesting, tho, that it still found most of them."
none,@jakeboxer @tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r laughing my ass off right now at people from github AND freebsd telling rogue he's wrong.
none,RT @adamdicarlo: @freebsdgirl gamergate do u even github http://t.co/zNCZVczFZC
none,"@MacLemon @dtm609 @Osw94k not entirely accurate. if you run strings through /bin, you'll find freebsd committer names of recent years."
none,"@MacLemon @dtm609 @Osw94k you're thinking kernel, not userland. quite a bit of recent(ish) freebsd userland exists in osx."
none,omg watching freebsd committers just rail at gamergaters for doubting my freebsd contributions
none,it's like christmas.
none,@NedGilmore yo.

none,@NedGilmore can wreck rogues when I'm disc. Not so much as shadow - but all my gear is heals. :P
none,A bunch of people poked me about some article that was written. Eh. I don't really care that much.
none,"I gave it a 5 second glance, didn't see anything interesting. Getting mad about that is like raging at a livejournal post. Same quality."
none,I only really have the time to respond to mainstream media. Reviewing everything that GG writes about me would be too time consuming.
none,"At least MSM manages to do basic fact checking, like not confusing @ggautoblocker with @theblockbot :P"
none,"@oolon you know this is like the only time a dude's code was ever incorrectly attributed to a chick, ever. :P"
none,Morning news included a story about Twitter safety shutting down ISIS accounts because they threatened @dickc.
none,"I'm not at GDC today, but I'll be there tomorrow. ;D"
none,"Well, to be more accurate, I'll be dropping by tomorrow during lunch. Hit me up if you want to say hi. :D"
none,@ncweaver i believe so. should be a client-side option (blocks processing happens client side as well)
none,@ncweaver that's fine. ^.^
none,Had to put off press photog until today. Now I'm back to frantically cleaning &amp; cursing myself for not having time for a haircut.
none,Watching GamerGate mock women that are concerned about appearing at GDC given the threats they've been inundated w/over the past 6 months.
none,Perpetuating a culture where abuse is tolerated and targets of abuse are mocked for speaking out against their abusers.
none,GamerGate is an intimidation mob. Speak up? Get threats &amp; dog-piled. Speak about the threats? Get mocked &amp; dog-piled.
none,"@filmpunk86 @smudboy @Steuph i've got this person blocked, please remove me from the conversation. &lt;3"
none,@Hollapalooka @thequinnspiracy i'm not giving a talk. ;)
none,Uber just reported hackers broke into their database. This happened last May. Timely reporting.
none,@ServbotMitch i'd be down for this.
none,Downside of using @blocktogether is that I have to create a new twitter account for each block list.
none,RT @Hollapalooka: Checked the #gdc2015 tag w/ &amp; w/o @ggautoblocker in place.  Like night &amp; day.  Guess which led to more productive tweets …
none,"@Jason_Gio meh. :P  thanks for the heads up, but not too concerned about another angry dude on twitter."
none,"@Jason_Gio this is the same dude that thinks that not being allowed to publish an article to a site he doesn't own is ""silencing"""
none,@Jason_Gio so his opinion on being blocked on twitter is probably fairly predictable.
none,@Jason_Gio he was already given my email a while ago by someone else.
none,I like watching logs. http://t.co/6w7R8ldFXO
none,What's a decent RoR on 401(k)s? I've averaged 9.2% over the past few years. Not sure if that's decent or not.
none,"@drbanks55 yeah, that's including fees. fees weren't too bad."
none,@cwoodfield yah. mgt fund fees are pretty low. ~$25/year.
none,"If I don't like who you're following, I block you. If GG doesn't like who you're following, they go after your job. http://t.co/4tfGUP0xRa"
none,"Bonus points in this thread. Unreal. Harassment from GamerGate did make abuse more of a topic, I suppose. http://t.co/98FNXeb9nW"
none,@KaitlynBurnell beats me. I was sent the screencap.
none,"It's human to react negatively to abuse. Trying to blame someone for reacting to abuse is, unsurprisingly, a tactic of serial abusers."
none,RT @ahtweet: @freebsdgirl How dare you have feelings is a fantastic way to dehumanize someone.
none,"This is commonly found in cases of domestic violence, but it's a favored tactic of GamerGate as well."
none,"It's another form of abuse, but more insidious, because the perpetrators think they are the heroes of this story."
none,"Stand strong. The only comfort I have to give right now is that no one is really listening to this particular group, anyways."
none,@AGeekCalledBob ick. DV can happen to anyone. :\

So very collusion. How ethics. Much wow."
none,@Palle_Hoffstein @ashleylynch @CranBoonitz amazed GG didn't try to spin it into a win somehow. They try to do that with everything.

none,"""I'm bringing it up for one reason. GamerGate has brought harassment into the limelight, but rest assured, it's always there."""
none,"This is a problem that affects everyone, but we have seen far more harassment targeting women."
none,It is fitting that we are now seeing these strong women speaking out and trying to fix problems that others are uncertain of how to tackle.
none,Oh gosh she mentioned me and #ggautoblocker in her talk and now I am blushing and trying not to sniffle.
none,"In this ongoing tragedy, we found our voices &amp; each other. We have learned to work together, and to support &amp; encourage these amazing women."
none,I can't even find the words to describe how much I value the work of all the people I've met during this time. How much I love all of them.
none,"We talk about GamerGate a lot. But the truth is, GamerGate isn't the real battle. It's a symptom of a larger problem."
none,"Online harassment is something most people have faced at some point, regardless of their views on ethics in games journalism."
none,"It's a really tough problem, because it's a BIG problem. It is far reaching. It has many different forms."
none,"The scope of the problem can discourage people from trying to fight it. Often this leads to thinking, ""what can I do? I'm just one person."""
none,"You aren't just one person. There are many of us, and we all have voices. But more than that, we have resources, experience, and passion."
none,You aren't alone in this. You're never alone in this.
none,"We have seen so many fantastic things happen out of this tragedy. First, we have @femfreq. Amazing advocacy. A voice that is far reaching."
none,"We have @crashoverridenw, an invaluable resource that provides emotional support for targets of harassment."

none,"Creating a reporting system is difficult, because of the human intervention and level of bias that is involved."
none,"For more egregious cases for harassment, we definitely need to be able to respond to those appropriately. But most toxicity isn't this."
none,"Having a high level of toxicity in your community can lead to more serious cases of harassment and abuse, so we need to tackle this head on."
none,Putting the tools into the hands of users is a GREAT idea. We need more active solutions for protecting ourselves.
